TODO FOR NEXT WEEK

MENU
"infinite" --> "timed"
maybe "infinite" is literally just infinite until you wipe out or mess up
options
    enable mouse on menu
    accessibility options
make credits typeable with animations or something cute
SFX on switching options

randomize which tricks show up for each jump
    dependent on jump height?
    3 show up and keep getting replaced as u do tricks
    style "drop" differently in the trick list 
        different color or spaced differently to show that it does something special
    
ramp improvements
    area near the end where u can ollie for a larger jump
    if u ollie before that, you wipe out
    
LEVEL 2: rails that u can land on
    can do tricks (special rail tricks), can ollie off, can also "grind"
    rail blockers that make u wipe out
    ollie off the rail without grinding causes a bug
        player stays on the rail and doesn't properly jump off it

game feel for unsafe/safe state
    wobble animation
    add sparks or something when ready to land

More chill lo-fi royalty-free music

TODO - LATER
Fix Time.deltaTime to make it look smoother


RANDOM IDEAS
training mode where time stops between tricks so you can take a break and look at the tricklist and see which one you should do next
maybe fakie and switch make things harder but they give u more points
maybe some tricks give you a mini double jump
    fakie and switch? the low-points ones?
"tuck" to bend down & touch your board (trick in the air but can tuck under obstacles on the ground
