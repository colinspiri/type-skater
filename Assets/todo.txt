TODO FOR NEXT WEEK

randomize which tricks show up for each jump
    dependent on jump height?
    3 show up and keep getting replaced as u do tricks
    
ramp improvements
    area near the end wher eu can ollie for a larger jump
    if u ollie before that, you wipe out
    
LEVEL 2: rails that u can land on
    can do tricks (special rail tricks), can ollie off, can also "grind"
    rail blockers that make u wipe out
    ollie off the rail without grinding causes a bug
        player stays on the rail and doesn't properly jump off it
    
Move unsecured score closer to player when in mid-jump
animate score penalty 

show in red text when the player messes up typing a trick
    animate it downwards when player messes up?
    or keep it there and let the player press backspace (-1 point each backspace)
        if the player backspaces a correct letter, then clear current text
game feel for unsafe/safe state
    wobble animation
    add SFX for when the player presses enter
    add sparks or something when ready to land
SFX for typing letters
    like a typewriter or skateboard slap sound?
style "drop" differently in the trick list 
    different color or spaced differently to show that it does something special
More chill lo-fi royalty-free music

TODO - LATER
Fix Time.deltaTime to make it look smoother


RANDOM IDEAS
training mode where time stops between tricks so you can take a break and look at the tricklist and see which one you should do next
maybe fakie and switch make things harder but they give u more points
maybe some tricks give you a mini double jump
    fakie and switch? the low-points ones?
"tuck" to bend down & touch your board (trick in the air but can tuck under obstacles on the ground
