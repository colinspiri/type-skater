TODO

-obstacles you need to jump over
-show when you bail out and lose points
-effects when you complete a trick
-construct level of jumps and obstacles

ideas
-maybe fakie and switch make things harder but they give u more points
-maybe a trick gives you a mini double jump
-rail where you have to keep tying "grind" to maintain balance but if you're quick enough you can do tricks in between


when you fall off the rail, disable rail's collider
