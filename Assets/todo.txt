TODO FOR NEXT WEEK

Fix Time.deltaTime to make it look smoother

Tutorial/level 0 to teach the player without obstacles
   pause time and prompt to hold ENTER to land safely

deactivate mouse cursor

zoom out camera so u can see more obstacles coming

try to change min speed & jump force so that 1 ollie is enough to hop over
    without push?
    or with 1 push?

ollie off the rail without grinding causes a bug
    player stays on the rail and doesn't properly jump off it
    
randomize which tricks show up for each jump
    dependent on jump height
    
show in red text when the player messes up typing a trick
    animate it downwards when player messes up?
    or keep it there and let the player press backspace (-1 point each backspace)
        if the player backspaces a correct letter, then clear current text

game feel for unsafe/safe state
    wobble animation
    add SFX for when the player presses enter
    add sparks or something when ready to land

SFX for typing letters
    like a typewriter or skateboard slap sound?
    
each level adds more tricks u have access to

style "drop" differently in the trick list 
    different color or spaced differently to show that it does something special

issue with "drop"
    player types drop when an obstacle is coming up but if u land properly then u get a speed boost
    maybe reduce the speed boost?

word per minute counter to show at the end of each level?

LEVEL 2: ramps that automatically jump the player
    but if you ollie near the very end, you get a larger jump
    
Move unsecured score closer to player when in mid-jump

More chill lo-fi royalty-free music

TODO - DONE
Fix rails so u can jump from below them
Traffic cones as orange triangles
remove invisible "ramp" that jumps the player at the end of a rail
Trick list
    remove score
    remove title
pause menu
    volume slider
menu screen to select level
add "drop" command to end the jump faster
turn game over into typing menu
    restart
    menu


RANDOM IDEAS
training mode where time stops between tricks so you can take a break and look at the tricklist and see which one you should do next
maybe fakie and switch make things harder but they give u more points
maybe some tricks give you a mini double jump
    fakie and switch? the low-points ones?
"tuck" to bend down & touch your board (trick in the air but can tuck under obstacles on the ground
