TODO

-construct rails
-show when you bail out and lose points
-construct level of jumps and obstacles
-music and SFX

ideas
-maybe fakie and switch make things harder but they give u more points
-maybe a trick gives you a mini double jump
-rail where you have to keep tying "grind" to maintain balance but if you're quick enough you can do tricks in between
-holding ENTER to secure the landing 

when you fall off the rail, disable rail's collider
