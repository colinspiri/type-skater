TODO

-rail: faster you're going, the less often u have to type "grind" (the slower your balance declines)

ideas
-maybe fakie and switch make things harder but they give u more points
-maybe a trick gives you a mini double jump
    fakie and switch? the low-points ones?

RAIL
-have to hold ENTER to stay on rail
    too hard, doesnt feel like you can type

-like the ground, but you can type "grind" over and over to get points
    eh, can be fun

-keep type "grind" to maintain balance but between typing "grind" you can do tricks
-have to mash ENTER to balance on rail
