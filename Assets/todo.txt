TODO FOR NEXT WEEK

randomize which tricks show up for each jump
    dependent on jump height
    
TUNE LEVEL 0 TUTORIAL
   push
   cone 1: ollie & ENTER
   cone 2: fakie
    
LEVEL 2: ramps that automatically jump the player
    but if you ollie near the very end, you get a larger jump
LEVEL 1: rails that u can land on
    can do tricks, can ollie off, can also "grind"
    
word per minute counter to show at the end of each level?
ollie off the rail without grinding causes a bug
    player stays on the rail and doesn't properly jump off it

show in red text when the player messes up typing a trick
    animate it downwards when player messes up?
    or keep it there and let the player press backspace (-1 point each backspace)
        if the player backspaces a correct letter, then clear current text
game feel for unsafe/safe state
    wobble animation
    add SFX for when the player presses enter
    add sparks or something when ready to land
SFX for typing letters
    like a typewriter or skateboard slap sound?
style "drop" differently in the trick list 
    different color or spaced differently to show that it does something special
Move unsecured score closer to player when in mid-jump
More chill lo-fi royalty-free music

TODO - LATER
Fix Time.deltaTime to make it look smoother


RANDOM IDEAS
training mode where time stops between tricks so you can take a break and look at the tricklist and see which one you should do next
maybe fakie and switch make things harder but they give u more points
maybe some tricks give you a mini double jump
    fakie and switch? the low-points ones?
"tuck" to bend down & touch your board (trick in the air but can tuck under obstacles on the ground
