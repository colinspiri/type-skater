RANDOM IDEAS
training mode where time stops between tricks so you can take a break and look at the tricklist and see which one you should do next
maybe fakie and switch make things harder but they give u more points
maybe some tricks give you a mini double jump
    fakie and switch? the low-points ones?
"tuck" to bend down & touch your board (trick in the air but can tuck under obstacles on the ground
