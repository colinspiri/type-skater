TODO

-obstacles you need to jump over
-stairs? rails?
-after completing a trick, make text stay on screen and fade out nicely 
-screen shake?
-display possible tricks on left
-display completed tricks
-show when you bail out and lose points
-show when you secure the landing and get points
-effects when you complete a trick
-add timer
-construct level of jumps and obstacles

ideas
-maybe fakie and switch make things harder but they give u more points
-maybe a trick gives you a mini double jump
-rail where you have to keep tying "grind" to maintain balance but if you're quick enough you can do tricks in between
